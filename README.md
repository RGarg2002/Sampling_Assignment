# Sampling_Assignment

The given task requires the program to download a credit card dataset from a specific link and perform the following steps:

Convert the dataset into a balanced class dataset using techniques discussed in class.
Create five samples using the sample size detection formula as discussed in class.
Apply five different sampling techniques (Sampling1, Sampling2, Sampling3, Sampling4, Sampling5) on five different machine learning models (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5).
The solution to this task would involve downloading the dataset and preprocessing it to balance the classes. This can be done by undersampling the majority class or oversampling the minority class. After that, we can create five samples using the sample size detection formula.

To apply five different sampling techniques (Sampling1, Sampling2, Sampling3, Sampling4, Sampling5) on five different machine learning models (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5), we can use techniques such as Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Systematic Sampling, and Snowball Sampling. These techniques will be applied on the samples created earlier, and the performance of the five different machine learning models will be compared using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
